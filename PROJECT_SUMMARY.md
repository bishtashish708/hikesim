# 🏔️ HikeSim Project Summary

**Current Status:** 50% Complete (5 of 10 steps)

A hiking training app that converts real trails into personalized treadmill workouts with AI-powered plan generation.

---

## ✅ What We've Built (Completed)

### 🗄️ Step 1: Production-Ready Database
Migrated from SQLite to Neon PostgreSQL with full data preservation. All 64 hikes and 4 test users successfully transferred. Database now supports concurrent users, better performance, and is production-ready with automatic backups.

### 🌍 Step 2: Rich Trail Data
Integrated OpenStreetMap and elevation services to enrich our 64 hikes with GPS coordinates, difficulty ratings, trail types, and precise elevation profiles. Data quality improved from 9% to 84% completeness.

### 🤖 Step 3: AI-Powered Plan Generation
Connected OpenRouter.ai (GPT-4o Mini) to generate personalized training plans in 5-10 seconds. Cost is incredibly low at ~$0.002 per plan. Users can now get instant, customized training schedules optimized for their fitness level and goals.

### 🎨 Step 4: Complete User Experience
Built the full user journey from sign-up to training. Created Dashboard (central hub), My Plans (plan management), and Plan Detail (week-by-week breakdown) pages. Users now choose between Quick AI Plan (30 seconds) or Custom Plan (full control). Mobile responsive throughout.

### 📝 Step 5: Onboarding Flow
Implemented interactive 4-step wizard that guides new users through fitness level selection, training availability setup, personalized hike recommendations, and first plan confirmation. New users now have a smooth activation experience with skip option for power users. Profile data persists for personalized recommendations.

## ⏳ What's Still Coming (Remaining)

### 🔧 Step 6: Plan Adjustment UI
Enable users to adjust their training plans with AI assistance. API already exists - need to build the UI modal where users can request changes like "make it easier" or "add more strength training" and see a preview before saving.

### 🏋️ Step 7: Workout Detail Page
Create individual workout view pages with exercise-by-exercise breakdowns, interval timer, completion checkboxes, and notes section. This gives users a focused view for each training session.

### 📈 Step 8: Progress Tracking
Let users mark workouts as complete, log actual vs planned performance, track consistency streaks, and see visual progress over time. Build weekly/monthly summary views.

### 📊 Step 9: Analytics & Polish
Add user statistics dashboard with charts for training volume, consistency, and improvements. Implement cost monitoring, performance metrics, and UI polish (animations, notifications, toast messages).

### 🚀 Step 10: Production Deployment
Deploy to Vercel with production environment configuration, set up monitoring and error tracking, configure production database settings, and launch the app publicly with documentation.

## 💰 Cost Efficiency

### Development: $0
- Neon PostgreSQL: Free tier
- OpenRouter.ai: $5 free credits (lasts for ~2,500 plans)
- All other tools: Open source

### Operating Costs (Monthly)
- **100 users:** <$1/month
- **1,000 users:** ~$10/month
- **10,000 users:** ~$100/month

AI is the primary variable cost at $0.002 per plan. Most users won't generate plans daily, making this extremely cost-effective.
